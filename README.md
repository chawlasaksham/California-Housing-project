# California Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **median house prices in California** using machine learning techniques.  
Multiple regression models are trained and compared to evaluate their performance on the California Housing dataset.

The project is implemented using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, with proper data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new input data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Housing price prediction is a classic regression problem in machine learning.  
In this project, the California Housing dataset is used to build predictive models that estimate house prices based on geographical, demographic, and housing-related features.

Three different models are trained and compared:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

The performance of these models is evaluated using test data, and predictions are demonstrated on a custom input.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- To train multiple regression models  
- To compare actual vs predicted house prices  
- To identify the best-performing model  
- To make predictions on new, unseen input data

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Linear Regression**  
  A baseline model to understand linear relationships between features and house prices.

- **Decision Tree Regressor**  
  A non-linear model capable of capturing complex patterns.

- **Random Forest Regressor**  
  An ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy and reduces overfitting.
